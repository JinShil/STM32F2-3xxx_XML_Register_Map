mode but with a longer wakeup time.
When set, the digital area has less leakage consumption when the device enters Stop mode.

These bits control the main internal voltage regulator output voltage to achieve a trade-off
between performance and power consumption when the device does not operate at the
maximum frequency (refer to the STM32F42xx and STM32F43xx datasheets for more
details).
These bits can be modified only when the PLL is OFF. The new value programmed is active
only when the PLL is ON. When the PLL is OFF, the voltage scale 3 is automatically
selected.
