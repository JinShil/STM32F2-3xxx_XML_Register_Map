# STM32F2-3xxx_XML_Register_Map
STM32F42xxx and STM32F43xxx registers in XML format intended for use in memory mapped I/O code generation

This data was generated from the STM32F4 reference manual (RM0090 - DM00031020.pdf) which at the time of this writing was downloadable from http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/DM00031020.pdf.  This repository, however, only contains data for registers relevant to the STM32F42xxx and STM32F43xxx MCUs.

I wrote a program that allowed me to cut and past text from the .pdf file and generate this XML (with some manual tweeking).  A version of that program is published at https://github.com/JinShil/stm32_datasheet_to_d.
